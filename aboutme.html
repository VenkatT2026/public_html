                        <p> Hello, my name is Venkat Tatituri, and I am currently attending the WPI Frontiers Pre-College Program. I am 
                            from Boston, Massachusetts, and I go to Newton North High School. I have always had a deep passion for learning and discovering new things, which is why I enjoy engaging in activities that challenge me both intellectually and physically. One of my favorite hobbies is skiing, wher
                            e I get to enjoy the outdoors while also testing my coordination and reflexes on the slopes. It’s a thrilling 
                            way to spend time with friends and family while pushing myself to improve.
                            In addition to skiing, I love building things. Whether it’s working on DIY projects or experimenting with ne
                            w tech gadgets, I find it rewarding to take an idea and transform it into something functional. This hands-on approac
                            h allows me to apply the skills I learn in the classroom in real-world settings, and it keeps me motivated to kee
                            p learning.
                            I have a particular interest in computer science and mathematics. The abstract nature of both su
                            bjects fascinates me because they present problems that require innovative solutions and the ability to think cr
                            itically. Whether it’s coding a complex program or solving a challenging math problem, the process of tackling these problems has taught me perseverance and creative problem-solving. I’m excited about the future, as I hope to pursue a career that blends my interests in technology, problem-solving, and innovation. </p>
